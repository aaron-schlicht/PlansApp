### Public Demo for thePlans.app (work-in-progress)

thePlans.app is a full-stack web application built on React TypeScript for the client and a NodeJS server built on the ExpressJS framework. Other technologies used include AWS S3 for file storage, AWS Cognito for user authentication, Google API for Google OAuth and Google Places, and MongoDB for a scalable database.

#### About Plans.app
Plans is a social web application and tool for keeping track of your schedule as well as your friends' schedules. With Plans, you can add detailed and categorized events to your calendar and access your schedule in a variety of comprehensible views. Along with your own schedule, you can navigate to your "Friends" feed and view a list of previews of your friends' weeks (a heatmap detailing what times and what days that they are available) or you can click to view their more detailed schedule on their profile page, where you can compare your schedule to theirs to propose a new event when you are both available. 

### Demo
The demo below details the scheduling feature, in which a user is viewing their own schedule and adding a new event to the calendar with details.
